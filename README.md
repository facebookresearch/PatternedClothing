# PatternedClothing

This dataset provides high quality registration of cloth dynamics by relying on a dense colored patterned. We release parametric models and registered meshes for both a patterned shirt and skirt.

## Shirt

We captured four subjects performing different kind of upper body motion and hand-cloth interactions:

</p>

### Model

We provide a parametric [model](./shirt/model) of the shirt with over 98k vertices associated to pattern elements.

### Data

We captured 4k frames per subject. Registered meshes for each subject can be accessed from the links below:

## Skirt

We captured one subject performing different kind of lower body motion and interactions with the skirt:

</p>

### Model

We provide a parametric [model](./skirt/model) of the skirt with over 123k vertices associated to pattern elements.

### Data

We captured 2k frames for the subject. Registered meshes can be accessed from the link below:

## Cotton Shirt

We captured one subject performing different kind of upper body motion and hand-cloth interactions:

<p align="center">

</p>

### Model

We provide a parametric [model](./cotton_shirt/model) of the shirt with over 113k vertices associated to pattern elements.

### Data

## Long Skirt

We captured one subject performing different kind of lower body motion and hand-cloth interactions:

<img src="https://github.com/facebookresearch/PatternedClothing/blob/main/images/long_skirt.jpg" width="1000" height="440" />
</p>

### Model

We provide a parametric [model](./long_skirt/model) of the skirt with over 133k vertices associated to pattern elements.

### Data

We captured 3k frames for the subject. Registered meshes can be accessed from the link below:
